			<p>My name is Kathleen Foreman and I am a 3rd Dan in WTF Taekwondo. I have been training for 16 years. I’m 59 years old and began my Taekwondo journey when I was 43. 
			I began training in Taekwondo with my older son when he was five years old and soon after my younger son was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. I was searching for an activity that I could do with the older one to provide him with a special time with me. I did not want to watch him in a sport as a spectator, and at the time, bowling alleys were out of the question because patrons could smoke. A co-worker suggested Taekwondo, and we have been training together ever since. He is now 20 and also a 3rd Dan. The younger son joined us in 2003, when he was 4 ½ and is now a 2nd Dan. Training with my children, for me, enables us to have a strong bond. We have traveled to South Korea together to train in the imperial martial art called Sippahlki. This is a martial art that employs weapons such as swords, long stick and other long handled weapons. </p>
			<p>As for beginning training at age 42, at first I could mostly compete with the younger students, but as age began to creep up, so did the injuries. I had to reconcile that my body could no longer perform at the same level it had in the past. That is not to say that I shy away from difficult techniques, it just means that I can’t get the same height or distance, or that I do not have the same power behind my kicks. But I am okay with that, because the main focus of my training is for fitness and health. I still enjoy competing at tournaments in poomsae and breaking, and I find that more adults have begun to compete as well. In addition to Taekwondo twice a week, we partake in a cardio-kickboxing class on Saturday mornings.</p>
			<p>For me, Taekwondo is a fun activity and is always interesting. I continue to learn and the classes challenge me both physically and mentally. I found other activities to be either boring, or too hard on my joints. I continue to train and look forward to becoming a 4th Dan and master.</p>
